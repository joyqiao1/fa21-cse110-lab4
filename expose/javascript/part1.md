1. value added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. value added: 20
4. The code returns an error, becuase the variable "result" be declared as let, it only visible inside of the if block, and cannot be called outside the block. It will show the variable not defined though.
5. The code returns an error. Since the variable's be declared as const means it can not change or be resigned a different value anymore even though it's inside of the block, so ie will cause an error, and cannot reach the line 9.
6. The code returns an error. Same reason with question 5. The variable's type is const means it can not change or be resigned a different value, so it causes the error at line 7, cannot reach the line 13.
